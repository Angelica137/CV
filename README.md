### About me

I had wanted to become a developer for about a year before I came to Makers. I started learning on my own, trying to carve as much time as I could, weekends, before work, after work, even the commute. Eventually, I found that the more I coded, the more I wanted to be doing this all the time, until finally, with enough savings set aside, I decided to quit my job as UX designer and pursue coding full time.

I am thrilled I can now face a coding challenge with the knowledge I can solve it, and am now looking to become part of an organisation where I can make a positive, tangible contribution as a full-fledged software engineer.

### There are some of the technologies I can use

JavaScript, Python, Node.js, Express, socket.io, SQL, Postgres, MongoDB.
Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, CSS HTML.

## Skills

### Pragmatic problem solving

I have always enjoyed problem-solving; this is one of the main reasons I have chosen programming. I have found that the systematic approach of design thinking has been beneficial when solving programming challenges.

Understanding what we are trying to solve, planing a solution and breaking down the problem into its smaller components is an approach that has helped me find solutions that are simple and scalable.

### Communication and collaboration

Working in close teams has taught me the importance of communication to both create alignment towards our goals, as well as creating an environment where people can disagree, voice their opinions and concerns in an environment that fosters learning and collaboration.

I think this is essential in a good team where we are constantly working under pressure and on projects that require the ability to learn and the freedom to think critically so we can achieve the best results.

### Curiosity mindset

I have always had a curious mind and enjoyed continuous learning; this is another reason why I am passionate about programming. There is so much to learn, and things change so fast.

During my time as a UX designer, I have been able to use this skill over and over to help me solve complex problems, from creating an investing funs market place to designing a wellbeing platform that using gamification to drive engagement.

In every project I have worked on, I needed to learn as much as I could about the problem space while working to our time constraints and client requirements, so I could design solutions to help us achieve our business goals.
